# AssociativeLearning
picture-number association task scripted in PsychoPy (python)  

# Directory 
- config_files_v2, data, stims directories must be in the same directory as AL_v2*.py 
- config_files_v2: csv files that includes pre-generated stimulus/trial sequence (controlled for stimuli & randomized for each session and subject) 
- stims: select images from BOSS. Not uploaded here - contact to request. 

# Stimuli Control & Resources
- Image stimuli are selected from Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) - Brodeur et al., 2010; 2014 
- Selection criteria
  1. familiarity (objects rated high as DKO or DKN are excluded)
  2. feature vector availability 
- Stimulis-response mapping was counterbalanced for semantic similarity 
  using feature vectors (Devereux et al., 2014, https://cslb.psychol.cam.ac.uk/propnorms)

# Directory set-up
- Download the whole MazeGame folder in your experiment directory (the directory where you keep experiment codes and run the codes from).
